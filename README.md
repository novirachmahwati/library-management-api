# Library Management System API

## Introduction
HelloðŸ‘‹, my name is Novi Rachmahwati. This project is developed as part of the Backend Engineer Technical Test for Altech Omega Andalan company.

## Project Description
This project implements a simple RESTful API for managing a library system, focusing on books and authors. This API provides endpoints to perform CRUD operations on books and authors, allowing efficient management of a library's catalog.

## Features
- Manage books (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Manage authors (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Associate books with authors

## Technologies Used
- PHP (Version 8.3.9)
- Laravel Framework (Version 11.1.3)
- MySQL

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-api.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd library-management-api
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    composer install
    ```
4. Set up the environment variables:

    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
    ```

   Make sure to replace `your_database_name`, `your_database_username`, and `your_database_password` with your actual database credentials.

6. Run the migrations:
    ```sh
    php artisan migrate
    ```
